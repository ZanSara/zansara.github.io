With the rise of more and more powerful LLMs, I am experimenting with different ways to interact with them in ways that don't necessarily involve a laptop, a keyboard or a screen. 

I codenamed all of these experiments "Brekeke", the sound frogs make in Hungarian (don't ask why). The focus of these experiments is mostly small home automation tasks and run on a swarm of Raspberry Pis.
