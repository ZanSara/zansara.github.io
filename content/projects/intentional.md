[Intentional](https://github.com/intentional-ai/intentional/) is an open-source framework to build reliable chatbots that actually do what you expect from them.

Pure LLM-based chatbots are very hard to control: when a lot of very specific instructions are pushed into their system prompt, their performance will get worse and worse the more instructions you add. These bots will work very well on small demos, but don't scale to real use cases, where you may need the bot to follow a very specific set of workflows depending on the situation it find itself in, without improvising.

Intentional introduces a new way of prompting the LLM in a way that gives the developer full control on the conversation at scale while retaining the  smooth conversational skills of the LLM.

Intentional is still in its very early stages: [get in touch](https://github.com/intentional-ai/intentional/issues) if you want to give any feedback or contribute!
