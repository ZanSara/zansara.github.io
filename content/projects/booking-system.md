Since my bachelor studies I have maintained the IT infrastructure of an alpine hut, [Rifugio M. Del Grande - R. Camerini](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PwdVC82VHwdPZJDE6). I count this as my first important project, one that people, mostly older and not very tech savvy, depended on to run a real business.

The website went through several iterations as web technologies evolved, and well as the type of servers we could afford. Right now it features minimal HTML/CSS static pages, plus a reservations system written on a PHP 8 / MySQL backend with a vanilla JS frontend. It also includes an FTP server that supports a couple of [ZanzoCams](/projects/zanzocam/) and a [weather monitoring station](http://www.meteoproject.it/ftp/stazioni/caisovico/).
