In order to find a quick way to design images for my more abstract posts, I figured that an [L-system](http://paulbourke.net/fractals/lsys/) generator could help.

You can find it here: [L-systems generator](/L-systems).

Kudos to the original developer anvaka, whose work you can find [here](https://anvaka.github.io/lsystem).
