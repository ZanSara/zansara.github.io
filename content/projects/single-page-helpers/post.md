Inspired by [Simon Willison's collection](https://tools.simonwillison.net/), I am also building a small collection of small helpers for common tasks that I usually get done using some free web tool. In this collection I list a series of webpages, each completely self-sufficient, that can be used to perform a basic task like cropping an image, generating a QR code, or visualizing timezones. All the tools are [open-source](https://github.com/ZanSara/single-page-helpers), so feel free to copy them for your own personal use.

You can find them here: [Single Page Helpers](/single-page-helpers).
