[Haystack](https://haystack.deepset.ai/) is an [open-source](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack) end-to-end framework that allows you to build applications powered by LLMs, Transformer models, vector search and more. Whether you want to perform retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), document search, question answering, or build agent-based workflows, Haystack can orchestrate state-of-the-art embedding models and LLMs into pipelines to build end-to-end NLP applications and solve your use case. Haystack has also an active [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/xYvH6drSmA) community you can join to learn more about the framework and get help if you face problems. 

In early 2024 Haystack published a [major release (2.0)](https://haystack.deepset.ai/release-notes/2.0.0), which was a full redesign of the framework. During my time at [deepset](https://www.deepset.ai/) leading this redesign has been one of my major accomplishments.
