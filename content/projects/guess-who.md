LLMs nowadays are headed for superintelligence, they say. They should make good tabletop game partners then, I guess?

In this repo you can find a simple implementation of a Guess Who game. If you're not familiar with the rules, here they are: each player receives a character and has to guess the opponent's character name by asking one yes/no question at a time. For example: "Is your character blonde?" or "Does your character have glasses?". Whoever guesses the opponent's character first wins. 

A very simple game that should be within the understanding of any multimodal language model, right? [Try for yourself](https://zansara.dev/guess-who/) to find out.

You can also find the game on [GitHub](https://github.com/ZanSara/guess-who). Contributions of all kinds are welcome 🙇
