For my workshop at the [Agentic AI Summit](https://summit.ai) I vibe-coded this small Jupyter Notebook widget on top of ipywidgets<8.0.0, for easy compatibility with Colab.

Install it with:

```
pip install jupyter-chat-widget
```

See the [documentation](https://www.zansara.dev/jupyter-chat-widget/) and the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ZanSara/jupyter-chat-widget).
