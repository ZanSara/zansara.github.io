- [_"Catch-22"_](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL276798W), by [Joseph Heller](https://openlibrary.org/authors/OL33512A) <details style="line-height: 15pt;"><summary>Summary</summary><small>Catch-22 is like no other novel. It has its own rationale, its own extraordinary character. It moves back and forth from hilarity to horror. It is outrageously funny and strangely affecting. It is totally original. Set in the closing months of World War II in an American bomber squadron off Italy, Catch-22 is the story of a bombardier named Yossarian, who is frantic and furious because thousands of people he hasn't even met keep trying to kill him. Catch-22 is a microcosm of the twentieth-century world as it might look to someone dangerously sane. It is a novel that lives and moves and grows with astonishing power and vitality -- a masterpiece of our time.</small></details>
- [_"The Good Soldier Švejk"_](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL835204W), by [Jaroslav Hašek](https://openlibrary.org/authors/OL71477A/Jaroslav_Ha%C5%A1ek) <details style="line-height: 15pt;"><summary>Summary</summary><small>The Good Soldier Švejk (pronounced [ˈʃvɛjk]) is an unfinished satirical dark comedy novel by Czech writer Jaroslav Hašek, published in 1921–1923, about a good-humored, simple-minded, middle-aged man who pretends to be enthusiastic to serve Austria-Hungary in World War I. </small></details>
- [_"The First Men in the Moon"_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_First_Men_in_the_Moon) by H. G. Wells <details style="line-height: 15pt;"><summary>Summary</summary><small> The First Men in the Moon is a scientific romance, originally serialised in The Strand Magazine and The Cosmopolitan from November 1900 to June 1901 and published in hardcover in 1901,[2] by the English author H. G. Wells, who called it one of his "fantastic stories".[3] The novel tells the story of a journey to the Moon undertaken by the two protagonists: a businessman narrator, Mr. Bedford; and an eccentric scientist, Mr. Cavor. Bedford and Cavor discover that the Moon is inhabited by a sophisticated extraterrestrial civilisation of insect-like creatures they call "Selenites". The inspiration seems to come from the famous 1865 book by Jules Verne, From the Earth to the Moon, and the opera by Jacques Offenbach from 1875. Verne's novel also uses the word "Selenites" to describe inhabitants of the Moon.</small></details>
- [_"The Drowned World"_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Drowned_World) by J. G. Ballard <details style="line-height: 15pt;"><summary>Summary</summary><small>The Drowned World (1962), by J. G. Ballard, is a British science fiction novel that depicts a post-apocalyptic future in which global warming, caused by increased solar radiation, has rendered uninhabitable much of the surface of planet Earth.

In 2010, Time magazine named The Drowned World one of the ten best novels about a post-apocalyptic world on Earth. In science fiction literature, The Drowned World is considered one of the founding novels of the climate fiction sub-genre. </small></details>
- [_"The Songs of Distant Earth"_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Songs_of_Distant_Earth), by Arthur C. Clarke<details style="line-height: 15pt;"><summary>Summary</summary><small>The Songs of Distant Earth is a 1986 science fiction novel by British writer Arthur C. Clarke, based upon his 1958 short story of the same title. Of all of his novels, Clarke stated that this was his favourite.[1] Prior to the publishing of the novel, Clarke also wrote a short step outline with the same title, published in Omni magazine and anthologised in The Sentinel in 1983.<br>The story is set in the 39th century and depicts the journey of the spaceship Magellan as it carries a large group of colonists in suspended animation to a distant planet after Earth's sun goes nova. En route, it is required to stop for repairs at the planet Thalassa, which was colonised 700 years earlier but the colonists there lost contact with Earth for the past couple of centuries. The story delves into the cultural and emotional impact of the distant Earth’s demise on both sets of colonists, and how humans from two different worlds and societies interact with each other.<br>The novel explores apocalyptic, atheistic, and utopian ideas, as well as the effects of long-term interstellar travel, high technology, and extra-terrestrial life. Additional themes include human survival, adaptation, and the challenges of starting anew on an alien world. </small></details>
- [_"Spin"_](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL14951012W) by [Robert C. Wilson](https://openlibrary.org/authors/OL28371A/Robert_Charles_Wilson)<details style="line-height: 15pt;"><summary>Summary</summary><small>One night in October when he was ten years old, Tyler Dupree stood in his back yard and watched the stars go out. They all flared into brilliance at once, then disappeared, replaced by a flat, empty black barrier. He and his best friends, Jason and Diane Lawton, had seen what became known as the Big Blackout. It would shape their lives.<br>The effect is worldwide. The sun is now a featureless disk--a heat source, rather than an astronomical object. The moon is gone, but tides remain. Not only have the world's artificial satellites fallen out of orbit, their recovered remains are pitted and aged, as though they'd been in space far longer than their known lifespans. As Tyler, Jason, and Diane grow up, space probe reveals a bizarre truth: The barrier is artificial, generated by huge alien artifacts. Time is passing faster outside the barrier than inside--more than a hundred million years per day on Earth. At this rate, the death throes of the sun are only about forty years in our future.<br>Jason, now a promising young scientist, devotes his life to working against this slow-moving apocalypse. Diane throws herself into hedonism, marrying a sinister cult leader who's forged a new religion out of the fears of the masses.<br>Earth sends terraforming machines to Mars to let the onrush of time do its work, turning the planet green. Next they send humans...and immediately get back an emissary with thousands of years of stories to tell about the settling of Mars. Then Earth's probes reveal that an identical barrier has appeared around Mars. Jason, desperate, seeds near space with self-replicating machines that will scatter copies of themselves outward from the sun--and report back on what they find.<br>Life on Earth is about to get much, much stranger.

- [_"Tau Zero"_](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL90571W), by [Poul Anderson](https://openlibrary.org/authors/OL24072A) <details style="line-height: 15pt;"><summary>Summary</summary><small>The novel centers on a ten-year interstellar voyage aboard the spaceship Leonora Christine, and it opens with members of the crew preparing for their departure from earth. It is an especially moving departure because they know that while they are aboard the ship and traveling close to the speed of light, time will be passing much more quickly back home. As a result, by the time they return everyone they know will have long since died.<br>From practically the very first page, therefore, Tau Zero sets the scientific realities of space travel in dramatic tension with the no-less-real emotional and psychological states of the travelers. This is a dynamic Anderson explores with great success over the course of the novel as fifty crewmembers settle in for the long journey together. They are a highly-trained team of scientists and researchers, but they are also a community of individuals, each trying to make a life for him or herself in space.This is the background within which the action of the novel takes place. Anderson carefully depicts the network of relationships linking these people before the real plot begins to unfold. The voyage soon takes a unexpected and disastrous turn for the worse.</small></details>
- [_"Ender's Shadow"_](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL49496W), by [Orson Scott Card](https://openlibrary.org/authors/OL25161A/Orson_Scott_Card) <details style="line-height: 15pt;"><summary>Summary</summary><small>This is Bean's installment of Orson Scott Card's Ender's saga. It is a great character building book for those who have read Ender's Game and want to know more about Bean and his background. </small></details>
- [_"Inversions"_](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL100772W), by [Iain M. Banks](https://openlibrary.org/authors/OL6924809A) <details style="line-height: 15pt;"><summary>Summary</summary><small>In the winter palace, the King’s new physician has more enemies than she at first realises. But then she also has more remedies to hand than those who wish her ill can know about. </small></details>
- [_"Lost in the funhouse"_](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL2974553W) by J. Barth<details style="line-height: 15pt;"><summary>Summary</summary><small>Lost in the Funhouse (1968) is a short story collection by American author John Barth. The postmodern stories are extremely self-conscious and self-reflexive, and are considered to exemplify metafiction. Though Barth's reputation rests mainly on his long novels, the stories "Night-Sea Journey", "Lost in the Funhouse", "Title" and "Life-Story" from Lost in the Funhouse are widely anthologized. The book appeared the year after the publication of his essay The Literature of Exhaustion, in which Barth said that the traditional modes of realistic fiction had been used up, but that this exhaustion itself could be used to inspire a new generation of writers, citing Nabokov, Beckett, and especially Borges as exemplars of this new approach. Lost in the Funhouse took these ideas to an extreme, for which it was both praised and condemned by critics. </small></details>
- [_"Martian Time-Slip"_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martian_Time-Slip) by P. K. Dick<details style="line-height: 15pt;"><summary>Summary</summary><small>Martian Time-Slip is a 1964 science fiction novel by American writer Philip K. Dick. The novel uses the common science fiction concept of a human colony on Mars. However, it also includes the themes of mental illness, the physics of time and the dangers of centralized authority. The novel was first published under the title All We Marsmen, serialized in the August, October and December 1963 issues of Worlds of Tomorrow magazine. The subsequent 1964 publication as Martian Time-Slip is virtually identical, with different chapter breaks.[1] </small></details>
- [_"The Book of the New Sun"_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_the_New_Sun), by Gene Wolfe <details style="line-height: 15pt;"><summary>Summary</summary><small>It chronicles the journey of Severian, a journeyman torturer from the Order of the Seekers for Truth and Penitence who after helping a client kill themselves is exiled in disgrace to journey to the distant city of Thrax where he is to live out his days as their executioner. Severian lives in the ancient city of Nessus in a nation called the Commonwealth, ruled by the Autarch, in the Southern Hemisphere. It is at war with Ascia, its totalitarian northern neighbour. It is a first-person narrative, ostensibly translated by Wolfe into contemporary English, set in a distant future when the Sun has dimmed and Earth is cooler (a "Dying Earth" story).

- [_"Last and First Men"_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_and_First_Men), by Olaf Stapledon <details style="line-height: 15pt;"><summary>Summary</summary><small> Last and First Men: A Story of the Near and Far Future is a "future history" science fiction novel written in 1930 by the British author Olaf Stapledon. A work of unprecedented scale in the genre, it describes the history of humanity from the present onwards across two billion years and eighteen distinct human species, of which our own is the first. The book employs a narrative conceit that, under subtle inspiration, the novelist has unknowingly been dictated a channelled text from the last human species.</small></details>
- [_"The Eternal Champion"_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eternal_Champion_(novel)) by M. Moorcock<details style="line-height: 15pt;"><summary>Summary</summary><small>The Eternal Champion is a fantasy novel by Michael Moorcock that introduces the hero known as both John Daker and Erekosë. Originally written in the late 1950s, it constitutes the first novel of Moorcock's sprawling Eternal Champion series. The tale was first published in 1962 as a magazine novella [1] Moorcock expanded the novella to novel length for publication in 1970. He revised the text for its 1978 publication. Along with expanding the original story, the novel makes some minor changes to narration and scenes, and also includes references to other short stories by Moorcock. The Eternal Champion is the first in a trilogy of novels known as the Erekosë series (though the lead character adopts other identities in subsequent novels). The sequel novels are Phoenix in Obsidian (1970; published in the US as The Silver Warriors), and The Dragon in the Sword (1987). </small></details>
- [_"The Way of Kings: Book One of the Stormlight Archive"_](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL15358691W?edition=key%3A/books/OL25883754M) by [Brandon Sanderson](https://openlibrary.org/authors/OL1394865A/Brandon_Sanderson) <details style="line-height: 15pt;"><summary>Summary</summary><small>Roshar is a world of stone and storms. Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.<br><br>It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars are fought for them, and won by them.<br><br>One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where ten armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.<br><br>Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by overpowering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.<br><br>Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under the eminent scholar and notorious heretic Jasnah Kholin, Dalinar’s niece. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan’s motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.<br><br>The result of more than ten years of planning, writing, and worldbuilding, The Way of Kings is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making.<br><br>Speak again the ancient oaths,<br><br>Life before death.<br>Strength before weakness.<br>Journey before destination.<br>and return to men the Shards they once bore.<br><br>The Knights Radiant must stand again. </small></details>
- [_"Auf zwei Planeten"_](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL4592774W), by [Kurd Laßwitz](https://openlibrary.org/authors/OL4389142A) <details style="line-height: 15pt;"><summary>Summary</summary><small>German sci-fi novel that was inspirational to young Wernher von Braun</small></details>
- [_"The Lifecycle of Software Objects"_](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL17268350W), by [Ted Chiang](https://openlibrary.org/authors/OL1604887A/Ted_Chiang) <details style="line-height: 15pt;"><summary>Summary</summary><small>What's the best way to create artificial intelligence? In 1950, Alan Turing wrote, "Many people think that a very abstract activity, like the playing of chess, would be best. It can also be maintained that it is best to provide the machine with the best sense organs that money can buy, and then teach it to understand and speak English. This process could follow the normal teaching of a child. Things would be pointed out and named, etc. Again I do not know what the right answer is, but I think both approaches should be tried."<br>The first approach has been tried many times in both science fiction and reality. In this new novella, at over 30,000 words, his longest work to date, Ted Chiang offers a detailed imagining of how the second approach might work within the contemporary landscape of startup companies, massively-multiplayer online gaming, and open-source software. It's a story of two people and the artificial intelligences they helped create, following them for more than a decade as they deal with the upgrades and obsolescence that are inevitable in the world of software. At the same time, it's an examination of the difference between processing power and intelligence, and of what it means to have a real relationship with an artificial entity.</small></details>
