At [Embrace.ai's November Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/embrace-ai/), part of the [Lisbon AI Week](https://lisbonaiweek.com/) I talked about reasoning models: what they are, what they aren't, how they work and when to use them. Is GPT-5 AGI? Is it an AI Agent? Or is it just a glorified chain-of-thought prompt under the hood? 

To answer these questions, I classified LLMs into a small "taxonomy" based on the post-training steps they go through, in order to highlight how reasoning models differ qualitatively from their predecessors just like instruction-tuned models were not simple text-completion models with a better prompt. 

I also covered the effect of increasing the reasoning effort of the model, clarifying when it's useful and when it can lead to overthinking.
