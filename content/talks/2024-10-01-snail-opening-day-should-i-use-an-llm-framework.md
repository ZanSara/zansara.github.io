For the [Springer Nature](https://group.springernature.com/gp/group) AI Lab Opening Day I talk about LLM frameworks: what they are, when they can be useful, and how to choose and compare one framework to the other.

After an overview of six application frameworks ([LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/), [Haystack](https://haystack.deepset.ai/), [txtai](https://neuml.github.io/txtai/), [DSPy](https://dspy-docs.vercel.app/) and [CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/)), we run a notebook where we used [RAGAS](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/) to compare four small RAG applications and see which one performs better.
