In this hour-long workshop organized by [Analytics Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/) I give an overview of what RAG is, what problems it solves, and how it works. 

After a brief introduction to Haystack, I show in practice how to use Haystack 2.0 to assemble a Pipeline that performs RAG on a local database and then on the Web with a simple change. 

I also mention how to use and implement custom Haystack components, and share a lot of resources on the topic of RAG and Haystack 2.0.

This was my most popular talk to date, with over a hundred attendees watching live and several questions.

Other resources mentioned in the talk are:
