Slides: [ZanzoCam: An open-source alpine web camera](/talks/2021-05-24-zanzocam-pavia.pdf)

On May 24th 2021 I held a talk about the [ZanzoCam project](https://zanzocam.github.io/en)
as invited speaker for the ["Hardware and Software Codesign"](http://hsw2021.gnudd.com/) course at 
[Universit√† di Pavia](https://portale.unipv.it/it).

The slides go through the entire lifecycle of the [ZanzoCam project](https://zanzocam.github.io/en), 
from the very inception of it, the market research, our decision process, earlier prototypes, and 
then goes into a more detailed explanation of the the design and implementation of the project from 
a hardware and software perspective, with some notes about our financial situation and project management.
