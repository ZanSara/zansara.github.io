At [EuroPython 2024](https://ep2024.europython.eu/) I talked about RAG: how it works, how it fails, and how to evaluate its performance objectively. I gave an overview of some useful open-source tools for RAG evalution such as [continuous-eval](https://docs.relari.ai/v0.3?utm_campaign=europython-2024) and how to use them with [Haystack](https://haystack.deepset.ai/?utm_campaign=europython-2024), and then offered some ideas on how to expand your RAG architecture further than a simple two-step process.

Some resources mentioned in the talk:

- [Haystack](https://haystack.deepset.ai/?utm_campaign=europython-2024): open-source LLM framework for RAG and beyond.
- [continuous-eval](https://docs.relari.ai/v0.3?utm_campaign=europython-2024) by [Relari AI](https://www.relari.ai/?utm_campaign=europython-2024).
- Build and evaluate RAG with Haystack: [https://haystack.deepset.ai/tutorials/35_model_based_evaluation_of_rag_pipelines](https://haystack.deepset.ai/tutorials/35_model_based_evaluation_of_rag_pipelines/?utm_campaign=europython-2024)
