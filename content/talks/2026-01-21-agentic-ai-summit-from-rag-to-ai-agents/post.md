At the [Agentic AI Summit 2026](https://summit.ai/) I show how you can take your RAG pipeline and, step by step, convert it into an AI agent. 

The workshop is based on an earlier [blog article](https://www.zansara.dev/posts/2026-01-07-from-rag-to-ai-agent/) and goes through [this Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1YVN5GrmZMM7qpI-dbeV-HIYig9XoSk6W?usp=sharing) where in under a hour we build from scratch a chatbot, a RAG pipeline, and then we progressively upgrade it to an AI Agent. Every step of the way is hand-on and you can take the notebook and adapt it to your stack for a more realistic example.
