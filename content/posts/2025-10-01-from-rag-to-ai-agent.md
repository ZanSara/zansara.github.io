RAG pipelines are apparently a thing of the past. Since the focus shifted on AI agents, the term finally seems to have acquired a [relatively well-defined  meaning](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/18/agents/), and it's surprisingly simple:

> An LLM agent runs tools in a loop to achieve a goal.

While simple, the concept at a first glance might seem to you very far from the one one of RAG pipelines. In this post I want to show you that RAG pipelines can be seen as a subset of AI Agents, and you can extend your own pipelines to become agents without having to throw away everything you've built so far.

# A simple RAG pipeline

In order to walk through this transformation we need a simple RAG pipeline to start from.

- A simple RAG pipeline
- A more complex RAG
- RAG as a tool
- Loop
