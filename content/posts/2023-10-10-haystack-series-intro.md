December is finally approaching. and with it is approaching the release of a Haystack 2.0. At [deepset](https://www.deepset.ai/) we've been talking about it for months, we've been iterating on the core concepts what feels like a million times, and it looks like we're getting finally ready for the approaching deadline.

But what is it that makes this release so special? 

In short, Haystack 2.0 is a *complete rewrite*. A huge, big-bang style change. Almost no code survived the migration unmodified: we've been across the entire 100.000+ lines of the codebase and redone *everything* in under a year. For our small team this is a huge accomplishment.

In this series I'm going to explain how Haystack 2 looks like: what makes the new Pipeline so different from the old one, how to use new components and features, how these compare with the equivalent in Haystack 1 (when possible), the principles that led the redesign, the processes we followed. I had the pleasure (and sometimes the burden) to be involved in nearly all the aspects of this process from the requirements definition to the release, and I drove many of them through several iterations: so you can expect a mix of technical details and some diversions on the rationale behind each decision in these posts.

For the curious readers, we already released a lot of information about Haystack 2.0: check out [this Github Discussion](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack/discussions/5568), or join us on [Haystack's Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/VBpFzsgRVF) and peek into the `haystack-2.0` channel for regular updates. We are also slowly building [brand new documentation](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/v2.0/docs) for everything, and don't worry: we'll make sure to make it as outstanding as its 1.x counterpart was.

We also regularly feature 2.0 features in our Discord's Office Hours. Follow [@Haystack_AI](https://twitter.com/Haystack_AI) or [@deepset_ai](https://twitter.com/deepset_ai) on Twitter to stay up-to-date, or [deepset](https://www.linkedin.com/company/deepset-ai) on Linkedin. And of course you'll find me and the rest of the team on [GitHub](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack) frantically (re)writing code and filing down the rough edges before the big release.

Stay tuned!
