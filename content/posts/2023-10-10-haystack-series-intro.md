December is finally approaching, and with it the release of a [Haystack](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack) 2.0. At [deepset](https://www.deepset.ai/), we’ve been talking about it for months, we’ve been iterating on the core concepts what feels like a million times, and it looks like we’re finally getting ready for the approaching deadline.

But what is it that makes this release so special?

In short, Haystack 2.0 is a complete rewrite. A huge, big-bang style change. Almost no code survived the migration unmodified: we’ve been across the entire 100,000+ lines of the codebase and redone everything in under a year. For our small team, this is a huge accomplishment.

In this series, I want to explain what Haystack 2 is from the perspective of the team that developed it. I'm gonna talk about what makes the new Pipeline so different from the old one, how to use new components and features, how these compare with the equivalent in Haystack 1 (when possible) and the principles that led the redesign. I had the pleasure (and sometimes the burden) of being involved in nearly all aspects of this process, from the requirements definition to the release, and I drove many of them through several iterations. In these posts, you can expect a mix of technical details and some diversions on the history and rationale behind each decision, as I’ve seen and understood them.

For the curious readers, we have already released a lot of information about Haystack 2.0: check out this [this Github Discussion](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack/discussions/5568), or join us on [Haystack's Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/VBpFzsgRVF) and peek into the `haystack-2.0` channel for regular updates. We are also slowly building [brand new documentation](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/v2.0/docs) for everything, and don’t worry: we’ll make sure to make it as outstanding as the Haystack 1.x version is.

We also regularly feature 2.0 features in our Office Hours on Discord. Follow [@Haystack_AI](https://twitter.com/Haystack_AI) or [@deepset_ai](https://twitter.com/deepset_ai) on Twitter to stay up-to-date, or [deepset](https://www.linkedin.com/company/deepset-ai) on Linkedin. And you’ll find me and the rest of the team on [GitHub](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack) frantically (re)writing code and filing down the rough edges before the big release.

Stay tuned!
