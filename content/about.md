I am a Python and GenAI software engineer based in Portugal, currently working for BNP Paribas as a Senior Developer. I regularly to give [talks](/talks) on the topic of GenAI, LLMs, and related topics.

Earlier in my career I've been Lead AI Engineer for [Kwal](https://www.kwal.ai/) working on voice agents and conversation analysis with LLMs for the recruitment industry. 
I've been NLP Engineer at [deepset](https://www.deepset.ai/), a German startup working on NLP [since "before it was cool"](https://www.deepset.ai/about), where I was the [main contributor](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack/graphs/contributors) of [Haystack](https://haystack.deepset.ai/), their open-source framework for building highly customizable,  production-ready NLP and LLM applications.
I started my career at [CERN](https://home.cern/), where I had the privilege of driving one [major decision](/publications/tucpr03/) to migrate the graphical interface's software of the accelerator's control systems from Java to PyQt, and then of helping a client department [migrate](/publications/thpv014/) to this stack. I have also worked on other infrastructure and data pipelines, some of which resulted in [publication](/publications/thpv042/).

Outside of work I have more [pet projects](/projects) than free time to dedicate to them, just as everyone else; I love science fiction and space exploration, I enjoy hiking and learning languages, as much as such process can be enjoyed.

I speak native Italian and fluent English, but I've also learned French during my time at CERN, I'm studying Hungarian for family reasons, and Portuguese because I currently live there. I still can understand some Russian and I have a very basic understanding of Chinese, both from my teenage and university years.
