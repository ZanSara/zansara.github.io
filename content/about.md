I am a Python and LLMs specialist currently working for [deepset](https://www.deepset.ai/), 
a German startup working on NLP [since "before it was cool"](https://www.deepset.ai/about). 
At the moment I'm the [#1 contributor](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack/graphs/contributors) 
of [Haystack](https://haystack.deepset.ai/), their open-source framework for building highly
customizable, production-ready NLP and LLM applications.

Previously I have been working at [CERN](https://home.cern/), where I began my software engineering
career. During my time there I had the privilege of driving one 
[major decision](/publications/tucpr03/) to migrate the graphical
interface's software of the accelerator's control systems from Java to PyQt, 
and then of helping a client department [migrate](/publications/thpv014/) to this stack.
I have also worked on other infrastructure and data pipelines, some of which resulted in 
[publication](publications/thpv042/).

Outside of work I have too many [pet projects](projects/) to follow up with than the free time I 
can dedicate to them.
I love science fiction and space exploration, I enjoy challenging hikes in nature and learning
languages, as much as such process can be enjoyed.

I speak Italian as a native and fluent English, but I've also learned French during my time at CERN, 
I'm studying Hungarian for family reasons, and Portuguese because I currently live there. 
I still can understand some Russian and I have a very basic understanding
of Chinese, both from my teenage and university years.
